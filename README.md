## Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeorgeVassilakis/GeorgeVassilakis/main/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Georgios (George) Vassilakis, and I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at Northeastern University. I'm studying Applied Physics with a minor in Data Science and a concentration in Astrophysics. Thank you for examining my work and portfolio. Here, various works of mine that are relevant to my graduate school admission are presented. First, I‚Äôve listed the various software and broad research projects I‚Äôve been a part of during my undergraduate experience at Northeastern. Next, I‚Äôve listed three writing samples that will supplement my graduate application materials. These are curated assignments from my advanced writing course that all relate to the central theme of my interests in graduate school: astrophysics and machine learning. Lastly, as further reading for interested parties, I‚Äôve listed the list of my peer-reviewed publications along with a link to my Google Scholar profile that contains these articles. 

## üî≠ I love space and machine learning! 
### My current and past projects include:
1. Lead developer of the [SMPy](https://github.com/GeorgeVassilakis/SMPy) project, which provides an accessible and modular Python toolkit for mapping dark matter distributions using weak gravitational lensing data from astronomical surveys. The Shear Mapping in Python (SMPy) package provides a standardized, well-documented, and open-source solution for creating convergence maps from weak lensing galaxy shear measurements. SMPy addresses an outstanding need for the lensing community: an accessible, well-documented, and extensible tool to construct publication-quality mass maps from galaxy shear data. Built on standard scientific Python packages, it provides an easy entry point for researchers new to mass mapping, while also being robust for more senior scientific use. SMPy is built with a modular architecture that facilitates easy implementation of new mass mapping techniques, encouraging open-source contributions. SMPy is, to our knowledge, the first convergence mapping software to prioritize both accessibility and advanced features.

2. Contributing developer to the [superbit-lensing](https://github.com/superbit-collaboration/superbit-lensing) analysis pipeline, which aims to measure galaxy shapes from NASA's SuperBIT Telescope observations. The pipeline supports both the generation of realistic mock observations of galaxy clusters that was used in McCleary et al., 2023 (see Publications) as well as input of real data from SuperBIT‚Äôs 2023 science flight. The workflow is split into three steps: building image cutouts with PSF models, measuring galaxy shapes, and creating tangential and cross-shear profiles. Shape measurement relies on the NGMix algorithm for shape estimates and Metacalibration to remove shear biases present.

3. Developed Scientific Machine Learning pipelines (coupled [Deep Operator Networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00302-5)) to model the governing physics for solid-state batteries, as part of the [Juner Zhu Group](https://www.zhujuner.com/). I developed physics-informed Deep Operator Networks that accelerated battery performance analysis by orders of magnitude compared to conventional methods. Starting from theoretical frameworks on battery physics and DeepONet architectures, I built an SSB modeling pipeline that drastically reduced computation while staying accurate and generalized. Through this project, I gained experience with large-scale algorithm development and learned how machine learning could offer a faster and more effective analysis compared to conventional methods.

## Writing Samples
This section showcases selected assignments from my advanced writing course. In general, the course allowed for great freedom in topic during the assignments. So, given my strong interest in astrophysics, I completed various assignments on astronomy and surrounding topics. These assignments include:
1. A **literature review** discussing how machine learning is revolutionizing astronomy, specifically cosmology. It can be found at [this link](https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/vassilakis_g_northeastern_edu/ERlyVw5lqRtChwMDprOe0jkBj1Znyxu7uUtJ4YcgyMl2Zw?e=Gr33iH). In short, this review was motivated by a need to understand how AI and machine learning are reshaping astrophysical research, particularly due to the surge in astronomical data volume in the age of Stage IV cosmology surveys. I examined recent peer-reviewed literature from the last decade alongside current telescope capabilities to capture the state of the art within the field. Key findings highlight how the ‚Äúbig data‚Äù era forced a shift toward automated feature extraction and bias correction in various fields, from cosmology to transient classification. Looking ahead, massive survey-based projects such as LSST (which took first light on April 15th), SKA, and Roman are driving the need for innovative ML/AI solutions. This is an effort I intend to take in graduate school.
2. A fictional **public correspondence** with UC Berkeley Professor Uros Seljak. It can be found at [this link](https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/vassilakis_g_northeastern_edu/ETYRpnX11jJFh8pljOA6Y3IBUaYMPn5ahlwTZZTaiY0T6g?e=XVfvfb). In this assignment, I drafted four focused emails to hypothetically plan, request, and conduct an informational interview with an expert in my field. I selected Professor Seljak because his work in maximum likelihood estimation and machine learning in cosmology directly informs my SMPy software. The assignment proved formative in how I now structure professional correspondence via email, particularly within requesting information from professionals.
3. A **public writing** piece imitating The New York Times Opinion column discussing the state of NASA underfunding. It can be found at [this link](https://georgevassilakis.github.io/advanced_writing/). I had an especially fun time writing this article, both because I am passionate about boosting NASA‚Äôs funding and because I am an avid reader of the New York Times, and I was able to download their HTML page to truly imitate their article style. I start by contrasting how today‚Äôs state of NASA‚Äôs funding is a meager 0.5% of federal spending compared to Kennedy era funding of the Apollo program. I proposed a three-pronged strategy to combat this: increase NASA‚Äôs budget, embrace public-private partnerships, and expand international collaboration. Hopefully, it will stand as a call to action for both citizens and policymakers to invest in America‚Äôs scientific future!
