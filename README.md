## Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeorgeVassilakis/GeorgeVassilakis/main/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is Georgios (George) Vassilakis, and I'm an intern at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory this summer, simulating dark matter subhalo detection with strong lensing for the upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory. Previously, I was at Northeastern University in Boston, studying Applied Physics with a minor in Data Science and a concentration in Astrophysics. 

## üî≠ I love space and machine learning! 
### My current and past projects include:
1. Lead developer of the [SMPy](https://github.com/GeorgeVassilakis/SMPy) project, which provides an accessible and modular Python toolkit for mapping dark matter distributions using weak gravitational lensing data from astronomical surveys.
2. Contributing developer to the [superbit-lensing](https://github.com/superbit-collaboration/superbit-lensing) analysis pipeline, which aims to measure galaxy shapes from NASA's SuperBIT Telescope observations.
3. Developed Scientific Machine Learning pipelines (coupled [Deep Operator Networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00302-5)) to model the governing physics for solid-state batteries, as part of the [Juner Zhu Group](https://www.zhujuner.com/).
4. For an astronomical data mining directed study, I created EMOS, which is an exomoon light curve simulator. It can be found [here](https://georgevassilakis.github.io/EMOS/).

## Personal
üèãÔ∏è I'm a nationally qualified Olympic-style weightlifter for [Northeastern University's Olympic Weightlifting Team](https://www.instagram.com/nuweightlifting/)! I built and maintain the site for our team's weekly programming. You can find the link [here](https://georgevassilakis.github.io/NUWeightlifting-Program/)!

üé∏ I've played both electric and acoustic (Flamenco) guitar for over 8 years!
